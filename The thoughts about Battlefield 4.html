						<p>I do like this game a lot. The map design is not great but still better than most of the FPS games around market. I did try to get something new rather than stuck in this game forever, and try something new for a time. But whatever had release as "new games" aren't quiet as good to catch my interest as this 7 years old Battlefield does.</p>

							<p>HK416(which in game is called M416) is an excellent rifle, it perform almost the same as ace 23 but 5 rounds 20 RPM less than ace 23. Since 416 is 750 RPM within a 30 rounds mag and ace 23 is 770 RPM with a 35 rounds mag. But 416 have an advantage over it is the accruacy, is slily better than what ace(23) have. And since I do like this from both Girls frontline and real life, I take this in my favorite anytime more than ace 23.</p>

							<p>Since all the commander needs is HK416, that will be my wifu for now on. And it works great, in any map, and situation, this is the best waifu for me. OwO</p>
